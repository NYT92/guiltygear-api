    "info": "Happy Chaos, or simply Chaos for short, is a mysterious character in the Guilty Gear series who discovered the Backyard and influenced the history of the world under various aliases. He assumed the name Happy Chaos during the events of Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2, and properly debuted in Guilty Gear -Strive-.\n",
    "design": "Happy Chaos is an athletic young man with light cerulean skin with white palms and soles, unkempt dirty blond hair, and a pair of short horns. A black halo with five spikes hovers above his head, similar to Jack-O' Valentine's. Rows of orange cross markings appear along the length of his arms and around his chest, collar, and back. A large black heart emblem with a golden cross and teeth appears on the center of his chest, with streaks of black ink seeming to drip down his abdomen. \nHe wears a pair of distinctive glasses with orange-tinted, x-shaped lenses, black leather pants, and a single black fingerless glove on his right hand. He dual wields a pair of futuristic revolvers, which are kept holstered on each hip. \nWhile infiltrating G4 he dons a secret service member's jacket, worn in a casual off-the-shoulder manner, which is carried forward into his design as a playable character.\n",
    "personality": "Happy Chaos's original personality is largely unknown, but he is a man who became overwhelmed by the complete knowledge of the universe, seemingly losing his sanity and becoming an unusually \"pure\" being. He views the concepts of good and evil as equal values, making him potentially end up causing major incidents or being on the side of justice. \nChaos is an erratic and unpredictable individual, befitting his name. The reason he causes turmoil is due to him loving the \"emotional part\" of today's immature culture. As humans pursue efficiency, they become mechanical and \"lose emo\" once it arrives. Thus, Happy Chaos does his best to always \"stir\" trouble and cause problems in any sort of way he can without giving a direct answer.  This leads to him often orchestrating scenarios purely to create drama, for example pitting humans against one another in life or death scenarios, sometimes without considering the consequences.\nThough mercurial and seemingly childish, Chaos is actually calculating and highly manipulative, and keenly aware of his own nature and weaknesses. He often plans many steps ahead, and is able to carry out exceptionally complex deceptions, often for little more than his own amusement. Even so, he enjoys taking things slow, enjoying the journey more than the destination, and prefers to devise strategies on the fly rather than to plan everything out ahead of time.\nChaos seems to be fascinated by the notion that things only come into existence when they have a purpose, and currently believes that his purpose is to help I-No achieve godhood by returning her power to her. It is also said that the future Happy Chaos sees is very boring, so he also sticks with her as she seems to be able to manage it. \n"
