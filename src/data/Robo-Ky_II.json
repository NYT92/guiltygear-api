    "info": "Robo-Ky II, also called Robo-Ky Mk. II, is the mass-produced version of the original Robo-Ky. His moveset and technical parameters can be customized, and has been built to imitate techniques from other characters, not just Ky Kiske.\n",
    "design": "Robo-Ky II is physically identical to the original Robo-Ky, though its colors are altered; white to red/magenta, blue to white, gray/turquoise plating to gold-ish bronze plating, and turquoise flashlight eyes instead of yellow. In its sprite, its \"teeth\" are the same as the original Robo-Ky's, only black.\nRobo-Ky II has the ability to adjust its body to use other characters' attacks, such as a race car that can fire eye-laser rays (Ky's Stun Dipper), grow a pair of large fans on its back (Anji's On), reveal a phonograph from its chest compartments (I-No's Antidepressant Scale), and so forth.\n",
    "personality": "Not much is known about Robo-Ky II's personality, but it seems to be very similar to that of the original Robo-Ky. It may be incomplete, however, and thus may react very randomly.\n"
