  "description": {
    "info": "Fanny is a strange nurse with an unusual connection to Dr. Baldhead, who saved her life from a sickness. She appeared in the WonderSwan game Guilty Gear Petit and its sequel, Guilty Gear Petit 2.\n",
    "design": "Fanny is a young woman, with blue eyes & blonde hair coming out of her hat in 2 large locks. She wears a white nurse's uniform, bright red stockings & a nurse's cap with a red cross & 2 wing shaped decorations. \n",
    "personality": "Fanny is a attentive nurse, polite to all & diligent in her work. She seems to be somewhat quick to jump to drastic conclusions, declaring that Faust is suffering from an 'incurable disease' due to his stretching neck and even mistaking a common cold for a life-threatening condition. She readily bursts out into exaggerated re-enactments of her conversations with Dr. Baldhead and carries a bald-cap and glasses to impersonate him, with that and her stalwart belief that the doctor genuinely saved her life alluding to her laser-focused devotion to him and his work. If one even speaks slightly ill of her hero, she'll quickly lose her temper and fight for his honor. \n"
