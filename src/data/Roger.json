    "info": "Roger is a supporting character in the Guilty Gear series. He serves as Bridget's weapon.\nHe is an intelligent and mechanized teddy bear that has been possessed by a ghost. Judging from his pretentious speech and behavior, Roger was likely an ancient warrior when he was alive. It is also said that he despises being compared to a Gear and will become quite violent towards anyone who refers to him as such.\n\n",
